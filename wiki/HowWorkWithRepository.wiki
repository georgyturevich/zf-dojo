#labels Phase-Implementation
=How to work with this repository=

==Basic Rule==
*Trunk* must be <u>*stable always/everytime*</u>! This is only one thing, which I demand/desire.

==Simple commits==
If you want change/repair/etc. some code in the trunk and you know that this changes doesn't affect/impact the trunk stability, you can simply commit this changes into the trunk.

==Complex commits==
But if you know, that you will need more commits, so you have to create new [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04s04.html#svn-ch-4-sect-4.4.2 Feature Branch] as is described in the Subversion book.<br>
So everytime you want to implement or work on the new component, you must create new [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04s04.html#svn-ch-4-sect-4.4.2 Feature Branch].<br>
E.g. you want to work on the new component e.g. dijit.Dialog, pls create new [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04s04.html#svn-ch-4-sect-4.4.2 Feature Branch] ^/branches/dijit.Dialog/ and when you are done, reintegrate it into the trunk.<br>

Thank you for your compliance with this requirement.
